now you work and complete your project on your repo, when ready you git add ., git commit -m "message", git push -u origin branch-name, now you can submit a pull request.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? You can't put a block element inside of an inline element. The differences are conceptual and the formatting differs.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? An element whose value/position is computed as fixed or absolute.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? margin-left, margin-right, padding
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
display block by default: 1.button 2.input 3.select
elements that display inline by default: 1.<span> 2. <a>
    inline-block by default: button
5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

The box model breaks down a webpage into essentially four parts, those being the margin, border, padding, and content. Each of these can be thought of as a box because you can change the size of them according to your desired design.
It can be problematic because you could have an element that you previously had at the correct size and then the computer will add these things like padding, border, and margin and things can overlap.
